Description: CommLink Telecom, a telecommunications company, is facing high customer churn rates and wants to address the issue proactively. They have engaged DataSense Solutions to build a customer churn prediction model that can identify customers likely to churn in the near future. This will enable them to take targeted retention measures and improve customer retention rates.

Steps:

Data Collection: create data set
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, duplicates, and any inconsistencies in the dataset.
Data Preprocessing: Encode categorical variables, perform feature scaling, and handle skewed data.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Explore the dataset using Python libraries (e.g., Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to understand factors contributing to churn.
Churn Prediction: Build a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict customer churn based on historical data.
